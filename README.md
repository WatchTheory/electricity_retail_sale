# electricity_retail_sale

With electricity prices soaring and weather condition throught the country, I though best to examine the effects of soaring prices around the country.
  - Analyze patterns and trends of high electricity prices.
  - Comapre prices between states to find the lowest and highest price of electricity in the United States
  - Identify cause of soaring prices.
  - Digging Deeper
     - Review top 5 with the lowest states and review states plan on managing electricity.
     - Research what new project the U.S has or will undergo in the 5 years to keep up with the demand.
  - Review the U.S infrastructure and how they keeping up with supply and demand
  
  These are just the few question I hope to answer during my investigation into to this EIA-Electricity Retail Sale dataset
